# AnyOverlay

I always hated that there was no good program to simply overlay images over games. I loved seeing Streamer's custom overlays, especially in games like Overwatch, but I saw that many people were disappointed that there was no way to use these overlays in game. To solve this problem, I created AnyOverlay.

You can import any image, and it will be displayed on top of any game. Any opacity, any image, even GIFs! (It even supports .WEBP, because it's really not a bad format, it just has poor support!)

**NOTE: This application will NOT work in Fullscreen! You MUST run in Borderless Windowed/Windowed mode!**
This is because Fullscreen applications take prioritization over other windows, and this program is designed to run on top of other windows. There is no way to fix this.

## How to use

1. Download
2. Run
3. Click 'Choose Overlay'
4. Click 'Add Image' and choose an image
5. Click 'OK'
6. Click 'Toggle Overlay'

and you're all set! No complex installation, downloads, restarts or privileges needed.

## Performance

I tried to design this program to be as lightweight as possible, seeing that it's supposed to run with games. I made it in python for simplicity and ease of use. I haven't noticed any performance issues, but if you do, please open an issue. I will be happy to try to correct any mistakes.

## Support

This program is made to run on Windows. Linux and MacOS support is planned but not yet in development. If you would like to see support for another OS or contribute to the project, please open an issue or a pull request.
